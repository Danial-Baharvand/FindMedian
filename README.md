# FindMedian
**Empirical Analysis of BruteForceMedian Algorithm**

The code in this repo includes implementation, testing and analysis of the
BruteForceMedian algorithm. The predicted order of growth of the
algorithm is compared to the number of basic operations and processing
time of the implemented program. The real-world performance of the algorithm is calculated and stored in a text file to be analysed in a report.
